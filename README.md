Strategy Game App - Rules & Mechanics
General Overview
The game is set on a custom historical map of Europe, divided into provinces.
Players control provinces, manage resources, form alliances, and compete for dominance.
Time progresses in real-time, with daily updates and actions.
Map Visibility
All players have full vision of the entire map at all times.
There is no fog of war; province ownership, resources, and movements are all public.
Resources
Provinces generate the following resources daily:
Gold used for actions such as expansion, trade, war, or influencing faith.
Food used to sustain armies or population. May affect expansion or unrest.
Faith used solely to influence the election of the Pope.
Faith and the Papacy
Faith has no in-game function except determining who becomes Pope each day.
The player with the most Faith at the start of a new turn becomes the Pope.
The Pope receives 1 global-use ability per turn from a pool of powerful effects:
Force two players into a ceasefire for one day
Double a provinces resource output for one day
Excommunicate a player (removing them from alliances for a turn)
Bless an army (combat advantage in next battle)
The Pope may not target themselves with negative effects.
Warfare
Players may declare war and invade adjacent provinces they do not control.
Combat results are determined by:
Number of troops committed
Province effects or terrain bonuses (optional)
Support from allies or Papal effects
Diplomacy
Players may:
Form or dissolve alliances
Offer or break trade deals
Propose vassalage or tributes
Betray allies at will (with political consequences)
Turn System
The game operates in real-time daily turns.
At the start of each turn:
Resources are generated
Faith is counted and Pope is elected
Previous turn actions resolve
All players are free to submit unlimited actions at any time, restricted only by available resources
and in-game position.
Action Limitations
There is no fixed limit on the number of actions per day.
Players may do as much as they are able, provided they have the resources, military, or diplomatic
position to act.
Examples include:
Claiming multiple unowned provinces (if eligible)
Launching several attacks (if troops and access allow)
Sending dozens of trade or alliance proposals
